module ProofBasedVerification
-- This is the work for Chapter 8: Property Based Testing
-- However, for Idris I am rechristening it "Proof Based Verification"
-- While "Property Based Testing" is still relevent with Idris,
-- I believe such Properties should predominantly be proven statically,
-- rather than "demonstrated with reasonable confidence" whenever they
-- can.
--
-- In an intuitionistic/contructionist logic/TT sometimesit gets pretty
-- hard to prove some things, so Prop based testing (ala QuickCheck/specs2)
-- is more appropriate.

||| This is an example of a theorem that's hard to prove in idris.
